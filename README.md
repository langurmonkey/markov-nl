Markov chain for NL
===================

`markov-nl.py` is a very minimalistic order-1 Markov model for natural language generation. It takes a file with a text and generates n sentences using a Markov chain. Just for fun.

Usage
-----

The following generates 20 sentences using `file.txt`.

```bash
$  markov-nl.py file.txt 20
```

For more help, use:
